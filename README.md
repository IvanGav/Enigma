# Enigma

This is an [enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) emulator.

Enigma1
- has a predetermined alphabet
- has original enigma rotors
- does not work like original enigma machine (input/output)

Enigma2
- different inner representation of rotors, but same functionality as Enigma1

ExtendedEnigma
- works like the original enigma machine (input/output)
- enigma is now stateless, and gets parameters from the main
- has rotor generator

ExtendedEnigmaPlus
- slightly more flexibility
- rotor generator changed to static functions
- WIP

For testing and playing around, change and run the Main.java's main method.
